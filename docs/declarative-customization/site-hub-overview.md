SharePoint hub sites connect and organize sites based on organizational attributes such as project, department, division, or region. Use PowerShell cmdlets, or the SharePoint REST API to automate tasks such as creating, removing, or controlling permissions for site hubs.

For more information on SharePoint site hubs, see **What is a SharePoint hub site**. <!-- TBD: Need link to this article>
