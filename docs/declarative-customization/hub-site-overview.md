# Overview of programming SharePoint hub sites

SharePoint hub sites connect and organize sites based on organizational attributes such as project, department, division, or region. Use PowerShell cmdlets, or the SharePoint REST API to automate tasks such as creating, removing, or controlling permissions for hub site.

For more information on SharePoint site hubs, see [What is a SharePoint hub site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869149).
