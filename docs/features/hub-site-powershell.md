# PowerShell cmdlets for SharePoint hub sites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The hub sites feature is currently in preview and is subject to change. It is not currently supported for use in production environments.

Use PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage SharePoint hub sites.

## Getting started

To run the PowerShell cmdlets, you'll need to do the following:

1. Download and install the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588). If you already have a previous version of the shell installed, uninstall it first and then install the latest version.
1. Follow the instructions at [Connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372.aspx) to connect to your SharePoint tenant.

To verify your setup, try using the **Get-SPOHubSite** cmdlet to read the current list of hub sites. If the cmdlet runs and returns with no errors, you're ready to proceed.
